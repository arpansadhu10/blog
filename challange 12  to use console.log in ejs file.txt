while rendering the ejs file in the home route we should pass the array posts as a object and in the ejs file we have access to posts in ejs and we can use the scriplet tag to console log then 


app.get("/",function(req,res){

res.render("home" ,{

startingContent:homeStartingContent,
posts:posts
};
});
